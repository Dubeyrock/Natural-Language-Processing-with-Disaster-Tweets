# Natural-Language-Processing-with-Disaster-Tweets

## Competition Description Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency. The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency they’re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies)...


🧠 Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building an NLP model to automatically classify tweets as real disaster-related or non-disaster-related.
It demonstrates how machine learning and text analytics can assist disaster response organizations in filtering relevant information from social media in real time.

🎯 Objective

Develop a text classification pipeline to identify whether a tweet refers to an actual disaster event.

⚙️ Features

Data preprocessing and cleaning (removing URLs, mentions, punctuation, etc.)

Text vectorization using TF-IDF and Word Embeddings

Model training using Logistic Regression, LSTM, and BERT

Evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Visualization of model performance and misclassified tweets

🧩 Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow / PyTorch, NLTK, Hugging Face Transformers

Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Matplotlib, Seaborn

📊 Results

Fine-tuned BERT achieved high precision and recall on the test dataset

Demonstrated potential for real-time disaster tweet detection
